        <h4 className="mt-4">THE YERB SHORT STORY</h4>
        <p>
          Yerbas is a community-driven open-source project and its direction
          is formed by the many contributors to the various projects of the
          Yerbas blockchain and ecosystem.
        </p>
        <p>
        The mission of Yerbas is to commingle the Cryptocurrency and Cannabis 
        communities by providing an easy to use reward and payment system benefiting traders, 
        consumers, artists, merchants and industry providers.
        </p>
        <p>
        The Yerbas blockchain uses the CPU mineable GhostRider algorithm for it's PoW consensus mechanism. 
        It was built to discourage specialty hardware such as ASIC & FPGA enabling anybody to competitively mine and increase overall decentralization
        </p>

        <h4 className="mt-4">WHAT IS THE YERBAS ROADTRIPMAP?</h4>
        <p>
          Yerbas is inviting all to contribute to its development. Head over
          to{" "}
          <a href="/roadtripmap/contribute" className="simple-link">
            How to get involved?
          </a>{" "}
          if you want to be one of our guardians. The direction of Yerbas is
          created by the many projects that the community chooses to undertake.
          From a fair launch, guardians choose to come along and strive to
          continue creating happiness every day, the Yerbas way. Yerbas
          remains a decentralised project with guardians rather than rulers,
          each whose projects and contributions stand or fall on their merits.
        </p>
        <p>
           The meme and art community surrounding
          Yerbas is strong, and our NFT platform will further add to the
          strength of this community while adding additional utility to
          Yerbas.
        </p>

        <h4 className="mt-4">THE COMMUNITY JOURNEY</h4>
        <p>
          Since Yerbas is community led from Day 1 and each of its features
          evolved during this journey is the contribution and efforts of
          individual community members in building this ecosystem, we are proud
          to present the RoadTripMap of Yerbas to you which will help in
          navigating all projects going on. It will also be useful to welcome
          new devs and contributors.
        </p>
        <p>
          The RoadTripMap is effort of Yerbas community in making this coin a
          real utility vehicle for different ascpects. Unlike what is the case
          for countless minted tokens, the community is completely dedicated
          from the beginning in building useful products for the future.
        </p>
        <p>
          We believe in adoption of this very universal currency through utility
          only. Yerbas is completely decentralized and is already adopted by
          many different members from different geographies.
        </p>

        <h4 className="mt-4">WHEN WILL IT ALL HAPPEN</h4>
        <p>
          The timeline working on such an adventure is not easy task, but the
          first steps have been taken for all of our community projects, and we
          welcome contributors to help us fulfill our vision. We already have
          powerful allies on our side, as well as a growing number of people
          eager to contribute development time to these open-source projects.
