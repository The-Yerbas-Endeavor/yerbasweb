      <p>
        We are Yerbas, a wild crypto-movement, exploring new territory and
        spreading happiness is what we do.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yerbas was created by and for sovereign people throughout the world.
        From a fair launch, guardians choose to come along and strive to
        continue creating happiness every day, the Yerbas way.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through all our lives we have come to value:
        <ul>
          <li>Continuation of the wisdom united into bitcoin</li>
          <li>
            Genuine usefulness with creative and elegant community built
            solutions
          </li>
          <li>
            Being courageous and forging new paths around a broken financial
            system
          </li>
          <li>
            Eternal emission rewarding all newcomers for securing the Yerbas
            network
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        We are free, warm and creative, and spreading happiness is our success.
