      <p>
        Who doesn't like to take pictures of their success. 
        Yerbas's very own NFT platform marks a feat never achieved before - create and trade NFTs on-chain, right within your browser. 
        The Yerbas NFT platform is geared to represent tha community and their intrests.
      </p>
      <h4 className="heading4 mt-4">ON-CHAIN TRADING</h4>
      <p>
        NFTs on our platform are traded completely on-chain. This means that every single transaction is done on-chain, and you receive your earnings and royalties 
        immediately upon sale. Since trading is done on Yerbas's blockchain, you pay ultra-low gas fees ({"<$0.001"} at the time of writing). 
        No more ridiculous overhead fees ever again, with Yerbas's NFT platform.
